## üîë How to Get a Gemini API Key

The Google Gemini API is crucial for the intelligent features of ZenithTracker. To ensure full functionality, you'll need to obtain an API key.

1.  **Visit the Google AI Studio:** Go to <https://makersuite.google.com/>.

2.  **Sign in:** Use your Google account to sign in.

3.  **Create API Key:** On the left sidebar, click "Get API Key" or navigate to the "API Keys" section.

4.  **Generate New Key:** Click on "Create API Key in new project" (if you don't have a project yet) or "Create API Key" to generate a new key.

5.  **Copy the Key:** Copy the generated API key.

6.  **Integrate (for developers):** If you are running the code directly and modifying it, you would typically insert this key into your JavaScript code where the `apiKey` variable is declared (e.g., `const apiKey = "YOUR_API_KEY_HERE";`). In the provided single-file HTML structure, this might be found within the `<script>` tags where API calls are made.

Please ensure you keep your API key secure and do not share it publicly in your repository or client-side code in a production environment. For personal use or local development, embedding it directly in the HTML file is common, but for deployed applications, consider more secure methods for API key management.
